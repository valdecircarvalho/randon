# Oracle DevRel Slack Channel Code of Conduct

## Welcome!

This is the official Oracle DevRel Community (OCI DevRel) Public Slack.

We strive for an open and welcoming community which respects all people who contribute to our open-source projects and via this Slack channel. We are committed to making the OCI DevRel Community a pleasant, knowledgeable, and enjoyable experience for everyone. As such, we are providing this Code of Conduct (CoC) to ensure all are welcome.

The OCI DevRel Public Slack is a dedicated community for anyone to gather for support and collaboration around the Oracle Cloud Platform ecosystem. Started in 2021, this Slack community has grown to hundreds of active individuals from around the world who have gathered to share their knowledge and expertise.

By using this Slack Channel, you agree to abide by the following Code of Conduct, the [Slack Acceptable Use Policy](ttps://slack.com/acceptable-use-policy), and the [Oracle privacy policy](https://www.oracle.com/legal/privacy/) (pinned to the #general channel). We reserve the right to update this code of conduct at any time. When updates do occur, a message will be posted in the proper channels to notify users.

## Update Your Profile :red_circle:

We’d love it if you took the time to update your profile and add a picture!

Share your pronouns with the other members! Add it at the end of your Full Name in your profile so other other members will be able to see it. Please be respectful of all members pronouns.

Add your interests or keywords (like ‘Kubernetes’ or ‘Serverless’ or ‘Java’) in the “What I do” section of your profile in addition to your Title and Company/Organization – that way other members can search for each other by these common interests. To foster more accountability for what people post, **no anonymous display names are allowed.

## Be Respectful

+ Be open and respectful to every member – sharing is caring and everyone should be here with the attitude to learn and collaborate
+ Have a positive attitude — be friendly, helpful, and encouraging.
+ Answer questions. Collaboration is at the heart of why we’ve brought this community together.
+ Be appreciative to those that have answered your questions.
+ No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes.  Be kind in your discussions with others and remember that everyone’s life experiences are different.

## Expectations:

The OCI DevRel Public Slack is not an official support channel of Oracle. While this Slack may contain Oracle employees who are happy to assist where they can, please refrain from mentioning or messaging Oracle employees with direct questions. If you have a question in which you require direct support from Oracle, please use our [official support channel or the community forums](https://support.oracle.com/MMOS/faces/welcome.jspx). Oracle reserves the right to enforce, interpret, and extend these guidelines for the betterment of the community.

The current admins are:

- Kim McMahon, Head of Communities, OCI DevRel
- Val Carvalho, Community Manager, OCI DevRel

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## Unwanted Solicitation of Services

This Slack is for community discussion and support; it is not for selling products or services.

It is unacceptable to message users directly offering your services unless the user has specifically requested this information. This also includes direct messages regarding employment opportunities or freelance projects. We have provided a #jobs channel inside of our Slack workspace where these kinds of messages can be posted to.

## Channel and User Spamming

This Slack has many channels tailored toward various functionalities and many users. When posting your message, please use the appropriate channel for posting your message. It is unacceptable to copy/paste your message across multiple channels for added visibility, post the same message or similar message frequently within the same channel, and/or directly spam users.

## There are no stupid questions!

This community and the entire workspace is a supportive space where you can ask other members questions you might think are silly or have obvious answers. The chances are, if you have the question, someone else does too!

## Social Rules

+ Use inclusive language. We strive to create a diverse and safe community in which everyone is comfortable participating. When posting in channels, avoid using words such as “guys” or “ladies and gentlemen” to address a channel. Possible alternatives: “all,” “everyone,” “K8s friends.”
+ Don’t be a jerk – we’re all in this together.
+ Use caution with jokes, everyone’s sense of humor is different and words can be misunderstood over text. 
+ If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.
+ Protecting IP and legally protected information is your responsibility and this is a public forum.  Don’t presume anything said here will remain private.
+ You are part of this community. If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, we urge you to politely dissuade such behavior. If you do not feel comfortable addressing the behavior, reach out to us at [devrelcommunity\_ww@oracle.com](mailto:devrelcommunity_ww@oracle.com). 
+ Use appropriate language – if you wouldn’t say it to your grandparents, don’t say it here. 
+ Keep this workspace safe for everyone. Do not send direct messages (DMs) or tag other community members who have requested not to be contacted. If you DM someone, they are not obligated to respond. Concurrently, if you are tagged in a post or DM’d, you are not obligated to respond. If the issue persists, or if the message is inappropriate in nature, please refrain from engaging in the conversation and reach out to us at [devrelcommunity\_ww@oracle.com](mailto:devrelcommunity_ww@oracle.com). 
+ Refrain from repeatedly tagging people with a question; this is a public forum and posted questions should be for response from anyone in the channel.
+ Try not to ask technical questions in a DM unless the other person has offered support and requested a side conversation to continue the discussion. 
+ Don’t abuse the ability to tag someone. Try to only tag someone when continuing a pre-existing conversation with them, particularly when responding to a question that they have asked. 
+ We have disabled the ability to tag an entire channel with @here or @channel. 
+ All posts reflect the views and opinions of its author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Oracle or its employees. As a participating attendee you are solely responsible for anything you post.

## Behaviors to Avoid

+ Any forms of disrespect — We do not tolerate impolite or offensive behaviors, including the use of explicit or vulgar language, images, and/or messages (e.g. racist or sexist remarks).
+ Spamming or trolling other members.
+ Illegal activity such as posting links to pirated content, advice on how to jailbreak software, or illegal bypasses of software security protection.
+ Do not post or link to any private information (your own or others) such as credit card numbers, passwords, product/API keys, or any sensitive personally identifiable information. + Take particular care when posting screenshots of your desktop.
+ Marketing — Blatant advertising and spam marketing will not be tolerated. Posting affiliate links to third-party services such that clicking on the link or buying the services within would directly or indirectly financially benefit the poster is prohibited due to the potential conflict of interest. Do feel free to share products or services you find useful where it applies to the workspace, or links to your own websites.
+ Don’t hate on tech you don’t like. There is a good chance there is someone in the space who either helped create or likes to use that tool. Treat people and ideas with respect.
+ There are no stupid questions. If people ask questions that are simple to answer on Google, answer them nicely still.
+ No links without context — A link in the chat without context or explanation may be deleted.
